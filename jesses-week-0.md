# Week-0 What I Have Learned

---

* <span style="font-size:larger;">HELLO</span> programmers! Below is lists of coding terminology and information.

---

## `Terminal` & `BASH`

Terminal and BASH is very straight forward. I never worked inside the Terminal, but once I created multiple files, I noticed how efficient using terminal and BASH can be. Here below is some terms i learned in week-0...

* This is an typing interface you can enter coding languages to program your computer
* The `terminal` allows typing commands to be entered, speeding up the work flow process
* `BASH` is a command interpreter to communicate with the `terminal`
* You can enter coding commands using `BASH`
* `BASH` is a command language interpreter
* Some `BASH` commands are: [*directory = folder*]

1. `ls` - lists all files in directory
2. `ls -a` - lists all files in directory [-a] shows hidden files
3. `cd` - changes directory
4. `pwd` - shows all listed directories you are in use this if lost and need to figure out a *tree* path
5. `touch` - adds files to current directory creates new empty file
6. `mkdir` - makes a directory
7. `rm` - removes files
8. `cp` - copies files without deletion
9. `mv` - moves files to chosen place deletes file in old place

`Git` and `GitHub` is a bit confusing to understand at first. During week-0, I created files, inside the `terminal` using `BASH`, then created a repository on `Github`. After I created a project inside `Visual Studio Code`, I followed a add, commit, push to upload my `VSC` project to `GitHub`. *Follow step 7-9 below for more instruction.*

## `Git` & `GitHub`

* GitHub is a repository hosting service, web based graphical interface. Allows programmers to research and edit projects. Provides access control for collaboration. Coordinates work among programmers across the world. Control system for tracking changes in projects files. Allows any level programmer research project information.

1. Created [`mkdir`] a directory
2. Changed [`cd`] to that directory
3. File is needed by using [`touch`][.md]
4. Open file with  [`code .`]
5. Use command [`git init`]
6. Add file next use [`git add .`]
7. Commit file [`git commit -m`]
    * [`-m`] means message *"add-comment-notes"*
8. Upload to github `git remote add origin http:...`
9. Lastly [`git push -u origin master`]

## `Markdown`

* Markdown is basic syntax. Created to simplify HTML. Has different symbols that respond like HTML. Used to create beautiful visuals in documents, presentations, notes and emails. Markdown has many short cut symbols and below is one example..

An example of how **markdown** simplifies HTML

[`#`] is equivalent to [`<h1></h1>`]
